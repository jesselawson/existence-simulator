# Existence Simulator

This is an open source idle clicker game you can play in your browser.

**Demo:** You can play my finished version of the Existence Simulator on [itch.io](https://jessesgames.itch.io).

It was built from scratch with TypeScript, Bootstrap, ParcelJS, and Yarn.

**Important:** This open source project _does not contain_ the end-game that you will find 
in the [itch.io version](https://jessesgames.itch.io) of the game. In fact, the end-game of this repo is 
not implemented at all. 

I hope that you can learn something from this repo, and I look forward to the games you will build 
and/or the contributions to this repo you will make. My closed version of Existence Simulator ends with 
everyone on the planet playing your game while you're the immortal president of the world. 

What will the community version of Existence Simulator be?
