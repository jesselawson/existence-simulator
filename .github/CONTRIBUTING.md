# Jesse's Open Source Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in wanting to contribute to this open source project! 

Your contributions will be visible in the project when they are accepted. Please read 
the Code of Conduct to keep the community respectful and approachable. 

This repository is an educational one; your contributions can be to improve the gameplay experience
OR to improve the educational value of the repository. Please use your best judgement as to 
what "improving educational value" means. In general, adding comments that explain how to use and/or 
extend systems, refactoring things to be less clunky and more easily understood, and creating how-to 
material for others interested in using this as a starting point for their game are all good 
interpretations of "improving educational value."

## Getting started

**Review issues.** It all starts with an idea! You can browse the [Issues](https://github.com/jesselawson/existence-simulator/issues) for ideas, create a new issue yourself, or just get to tinkering. It's a 
good idea to check that any issue you're working on isn't already being worked on by someone else. 

**Fork the repo**. You can fork this repository and tinker with your idea first, open 
up an issue and talk about your idea before tinkering, or pick an issue that isn't being worked on 
and start working on that.

**Submit a pull request**. Eventually you'll have some code you want to merge into 
the main repository. Open up a Pull Request and, in the description, talk about what you're fixing, 
the problem you're solving, the new feature you're adding, and/or what new content you've provided.

If your pull request addresses a specific issue, please link to it in the PR description.
