# Jesse's Open Source Code of Conduct

We all ought to be committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.

Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

You will be excluded from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. For a list of behaviors that are considered harassment, review the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md#4-unacceptable-behavior). In particular, we all ought to reject behavior that excludes people in marginalized groups.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact [Jesse](https://github.com/jesselawson). Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, open source communities ought to be a safe place for you -- and the community members will support you.

Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
